# Notes


## Data:

> Lexical data was collected from 30 Tupi패-Guarani패 languages spanning all eight conventionally recognized subgroups, as well as from two non-TG Tupian languages, Aweti패 and Mawe패, which serve as outgroups for the phylogenetic analysis. The 30 TG languages that were selected include all languages for which we had access to non- trivial quantities of lexical data
